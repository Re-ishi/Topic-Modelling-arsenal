The Pure Bar is going to keep you feeling fuller longer than if you were to grab up a candy bar, plus, with the Pure Bar, you're not getting all that refined sugar, trans-fat, saturated fat, and guilt that is served up in a candy bar wrapper.Pure Bar is sweet enough to chase off a craving for sugar.  In fact, for something that's made of raw fruit and raw nuts, it's quite sweet, bordering a little bit on that kind of sweet that gets you in the back of the throat if you're not careful.  But taking smaller bites and chewing thoroughly helps with this, as opposed to biting off a quarter of the bar at once. The fruit flavor is very intense, and so are the flavors of each individual nut.  That really impressed me!

It's a better choice than a candy bar, but me, personally, I wouldn't want to use this as an everyday stand-in for breakfast or lunch, simply because the Pure Bar still contains 190 calories, in a little bar-sized package that will be eaten up in under two minutes, even if one were to take smaller bites than the previously-mentioned quarter-of-the-bar-sized bites.

I don't actively look for organic food (though I appreciate the concept).

It's a bit chewy (which I would expect considering the ingredients) with the crunch of nuts. Overall I found it to be a very tasty bar which I can see eating for a mid-morning or afternoon snack.Nutritionally, this bar has 8g of fat, no trans fat, and  3g of fiber (12% DV), which is described as high fiber (in the Amazon description) but that doesn't seem all that high to me (the bar is more honest as describing it as a good source of fiber).Looking over the ingredients everything is listed as organic, with nothing cooked, or processed. Ingredients are listed in this order: Cashews, Walnuts, Rice Protein Concentrate, Wild Blueberries (with Apple Juice Concentrate and Sunflower Oil), Agave Nectar, Almonds, Lemon Juice Concentrate, and Blueberry Flavoring. For a blueberry bar, I wish that the blueberry ingredients were listed higher.Overall, I think these bars would appeal to someone who's interested in organic food or someone who's looking for a gluten-free, raw snack that's also tasty.

If you're not allergic, it may make for a nice snack, if you are not bothered by the following.First off, the primary flavor of this bar comes from the ground dates.  While I could taste the blueberry in it, it was more something that would sneak up on me every few bites or so.  Mostly, it tasted like I was eating a ground date bar.  The nuts provide a nice crunchy contrast but, like the blueberries, I only encountered them every couple of bites.  If you're a big fan of dates, you would likely really enjoy this bar.  If you don't like dates, this is definitely not for you.The thing that really held me back from truly liking the bar, though, was the texture of it.  I liked the crunch of the nuts, but the bar has a very grainy texture, which is also a result of its being mostly dates.  With each bite I took, I liked the flavor and really wanted to like the bar, but I just couldn't get past the texture.

At room temperature, it's not dry like most breakfast bars, nor is it as chewy / hard as many energy bars. Instead, it had the texture and consistency of maybe a dense fruitcake? Flavor was nice. Not too strong, not any hint of that weird protein taste, not too sugary... pleasant (in my opinion). I ended up wolfing it down and then checked the nutrition info on the back.This bar isn't going to fill your daily fiber requirement, nor is it going to satisfy a bodybuilder's protein requirement, but I found the nutritional value to be very well balanced and healthful. Lots of vitamins, 12% of your fiber, low carbs (compared to many other energy / breakfast bars), a decent amount of protein (7g, again nothing crazy but also better than most sweetsy breakfast bars), low fat... plus, whether you're a vegan or not, you can't really knock it for being organic and made with all vegan ingredients.I really do believe I will begin buying this bar as an alternative to fruit when I need a quick breakfast or energy on the go.

Very smooth cherry flavor. Although I'm also a big fan of the cashews...both for nutritional reasons and flavor, you won't taste much cashew in the bar, per se, as they are finely ground.Did I like it a lot? Yes.  Did I crave more? Not really. But I tend to eat more veggies and protein than I ever do fruit as a personal preference so, that being said, I think they may very well be \"crave-able\" to fruit fans wanting a healthy boost.I workout every day and love a good energy-burst bar prior to doing so, but have found most powerbars are packed with refined sugar and artificial ingredients. That's a boost that undoes all the good my workout does! So finding one that's filled with good natural things is always a quest I am on. While some of the newer bars have \"natural\" ingredients, however, this one goes a step further by having those natural ingredients also be organic...so the chemicals used in growing fruits in some bars that may or may not be washed off prior to processing into a natural bar is not a concern here. That's especially good for a healthy snack for kids, but is a preferance for myself as well.The bar is entirely \"raw\" organic foods...the best for your body, filled with antioxidants. It is high fiber and has 400 mg of omega 3s...very important and many would rather eat a treat than salmon. They are gluten free, dairy free, nongmo.The ingredient list is basic...no refined sugar, just organic cherries, nuts, dates...natural things.These are certified organic. Some foods that claim to be organic have been shown not to be...so this stamp is important meaning it's regulated. They are low sodium.So why one less star? The small bar also has 200 calories. That may not matter to many, but I am short and also have a small build and 200 calories for a snack is actually too much for me if I don't want to undo an entire workout. Eating this as an energy bar prior to a workout would, therefore, undo my whole workout. I wish they could lower the fruit sugars a tad...BUT, that sad...this bar kept me full for a LONG time!!

They eat them for breakfast, snacks, lunch and, if I would allow, dinner. We are always on the look out for new products that are delicious, but also healthy. So, the Pure Bar definitely appealed to us. When our sample bar arrived, I cut each of my kids (hereafter \"the bar nuts\") a slice. I deliberately separated them to ascertain their opinions.First up - the picky bar nut - my elementary school aged child: she was highly skeptical of the bar based on appearance. It is kind of a muddy colored mush. She took a small bite, chewed while pulling a face and said, \"I don't like this, do I have to eat any more?\" I asked her what she didn't like about the bar and it was basically everything from flavor to texture to appearance.Second-at-bat - the laid back bar nut - my middle school/cool child. He didn't mind the appearance of the bar, in fact I am not sure he took note of it at all. He put the entire piece of bar in his mouth, chewed it slowly and said, \"yeah, these are good.\" Upon intensive grilling he admitted to liking the texture of the bar and the sweetness but noted that the nuts did not add flavor. (Whew - what is it with this age boy? It is like pulling teeth to get anything non-gaming system related out of them.)Third in line - the bar nut connoisseur - my young high schooler is the biggest bar consumer. He can empty a box in an afternoon. He was probably the most excited about the bar tasting and eagerly agreed to give his expert opinion. I gave him a jumbo slice of the bar and sat back to await the verdict. First he cleansed his palate with water, next he sniffed the bar, then he took a good sized bite, he slowly chewed the bar and a look of . . . total revulsion crossed his face. He swallowed and announced, \"personally, I think it rather horrible.\"Last at bat - the fashionable bar nut - my eldest child likes her bars fruit filled and healthy. She definitely liked the fact that the bars were organic and filled with raw fruit and nuts. She said that the packaging and bar appearance made her think they would be good for you. She liked the fruity sweetness of the bars and found the texture to be much like those of the multigrain cereal bars but a bit denser. When told that the tasting event was over, she promptly snatched up the remaining bits of the bar and gobbled them down.All in all I would say that these bars are a matter of taste. If you like really sweet, dense nut bars you will probably like these. If you are more of a grainy, crunchy bar lover, you probably won't.

I keep it under VERY tight control, my A1Cs have been normal (high normal, but normal) all that time, so any new product that can delight my taste buds containing relatively little sugar (or better yet, none), is something I'm willing to try.  I also love cherries and cashews, so I figured this was a no-brainer.When I opened the Pure bar, it was as if the bar was compressed together, and upon tasting it, I tasted dates and cherries almost exclusively, both of which I like. The consistency was good, and the bar was chewy, which I also liked, but not as crunchy from the cashews as I would have liked.  Where WERE these cashews, anyway?  I looked at the label, and noticed the order of ingredients, and the first three are dates, cashews and cherries, all organic. I think they pulverized the cashews too much as well as the walnuts and almonds in the bar, as they all lent a sort of nutty rather than crunchy consistency to the bar, and the flavor of each (especially the cashews), was indistinguishable from the others.  Since I love cashews, and it was listed as the second ingredient, I was disappointed I couldn't tell them apart flavor-wise.  Maybe if they didn't crush them so much, the flavor of the cashews would be as distinct as the flavors of the dates and cherries, which would elevate the taste of the bar from good to great.  The bar would also have been more crunchy, something that's satisfying to me in any fruit and nut bar, organic or not.I looked at the nutritional value and saw that there was 25 grams of carbs, 17 grams of sugar (from organic agave nectar), and 8 grams of fat in a 190 calorie 1.7 oz bar.  While the Pure bar tasted good and kudos for its ingredients being all organic, it fell short of my expectations, and I was thinking I could have an entire 16 oz. can of fruit (pineapple chunks or peach halves in their own juice), for about the same values (including calories), as this 1.7 oz. bar.For diabetic purposes, I WOULD carry one or two of these around if I knew I wasn't going to be home all day and missing a few meals.  They DO taste good, take up very little space, and I'm sure they would keep my energy and sugar levels up until I got home.  I also like the fact that they're completely organic.

The problem is that Butterfinger and 3 Musketeers bars taste good but have no redeeming value whatsoever, and alternative snack bars that provide reasonable nutritional return generally taste like cardboard - or at least as how I imagine cardboard would taste were I to try it.So here we have a Pure Organic Wild Blueberry \"raw fruit & nut bar.\" Sounds good. I like raw fruit and I like nuts, so I'm inspired by the wrapper. The wrapper also has a sketch of \"Veronica,\" the creator of the PURE bar. I know nothing about Veronica but she appears trustworthy. She doesn't look like she just chewed on cardboard. The nutritional information indicates that there is 6g of protein here among 190 total calories. There's a small amount of multiple nutrients, but nothing stands out in terms of this being a significant source for anything critical. On the other hand, there's nothing bad here. So this bar looks, from the numbers, to be a reasonable snack.My bar says, \"Best by 14 MAR 11.\" That seems very specific given the time until then. On March 13, 2011, it will be fine, but on March 15, all bets are off. But I'm assuming that 14 MAR 11 means March 14, 2011 and maybe it means something else.On opening, the bar has a pleasant aroma. It looks like a fig newton turned inside out. The consistency is similar to the inside of a fig newton without being quite as gooey. It's pleasantly moist, without the uncomfortably dry texture so familiar from similar products. The bar contains nuts. I was pleased to see that I could identify the contents by taste; I looked at the ingredient list only after tasting the bar. There are no artificial additives here, and even the natural flavorings don't overpower the bar. There wasn't too much sweetening either so the bar tastes good without being sickeningly sweet.On the downside, my bar is labeled \"Wild Blueberry.\" I didn't taste very much in the way of blueberry. Dates, yes. Blueberry, not so much. Calling the bar \"Wild Date\" would be more accurate, though perhaps not as easy to market. Wild blueberries, if you've never spent part of your summer picking them in the woods, don't have a great deal of taste. As kids, we used to take a big pile of them and eat them all at once because if you ate them one-at-a-time, it was like eating nothing.So overall, a fine snack product. I'd change the name to something more suitable, perhaps less blueberry oriented, but I'd leave the actual snack bar alone -- it's just right. Getting a bunch of these to store in the car glove box would not be a bad idea at all.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not overly sweet...perfect snack", "unixReviewTime": 1271721600, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2010"}

I mention that not to brag but because Pure Bar was rather miserly with their sample size and I received a whopping one bar. With a product like this it can be difficult to make an accurate judgment, particularly on taste with just a single bar but I will try to do just that.It certainly wasn't love at first bite. The \"Pure\" bar is rather dense and chewy with large chunks of nuts, dates and blue berries. My initial reaction was to compare it to a fruit cake and I am not a fan of fruit cakes. After a few more bites it started to grow on me but then it was done. In the end I would give the taste a good score. It's not as tasty as a candy bar but it's not advertised as a desert, it falls under the category of cereal bar. As a breakfast replacement it's good for people on the go and I could definitely see it useful for travel and sports for a quick burst of energy.Where Pure Bar excels is in the ingredients and I'm willing to accept a less than staggeringly awesome taste given the fact that there are precisely zero chemicals and preservatives. Well, actually I'm not sure what Rice Protein Concentrate is but the rest is just dates, cashews, blue berries, walnuts, agave nectar and almonds. As the back of the bar says \"that's all! Nothing cooked. Nothing processed. Completely PURE.\".Nearly $1.70 per bar is a little high but not killer. You can get a bit of mileage out of 190 calories and I figure there is an extra overhead to getting all organic ingredients with no preservatives.

I expected dry and tasteless but was pleasantly surprised to find it moist and flavorful.  Similar in taste to a Fruit or Fig Newton without the extra sugar, salt, nonessentials, and unhealthy ingredients. The all natural unrefined ingredients were a refreshing change from so many other over-processed bars that load up on sugar, salt, and chocolate to make them appealing. At the same time this bar is extremely filling without that spiked hungry feeling half an hour later that leaves you wanting more.  The most enjoyable thing about this bar is that you can taste the real blueberries. The dates, nuts, and other natural organic ingredients in this bar are noticeable but they don't seem to detract in any way from the blueberry flavor.Although high in calories (190 per bar), it has 0g of sodium, 3 g of fiber, 19g sugar 6g protein, making it a well within reason as a nutritious snack for someone who lives a healthy active lifestyle. I believe these bars would be great for anyone wishing to improve eating habits to include more natural and wholesome ingredients, or prefers organic foods to more processed and refined snacks, and perfect for Vegetarians and Vegans alike. But this bar might be a little too high in calories to be considered a weight-loss snack bar and possibly lacking in enough essential nutrients to be a full meal replacement.

Maybe that is the nature of unprocessed food!  I don't eat a lot of organic food and the only raw food I eat is plain fruits and veggies.

The texture reminds me of an oatmeal bar, it is firm and chewy.  The bar definitely has a date flavor.  Personally, I found the tart cherries being the dominant flavor.Overall, the bar did have a subtly sweet, pleasing flavor.  At first bite, I thought the tartness of the cherries was quite excessive, but I quickly got used to it.One thing I did not like about this bar was the lack of crunch given the amount of nuts in it.  I expected more of a crunch to it, but the nuts seemed to be chopped up pretty well and there really is not a nice crunch to give a variety to the texture.Overall, I was quite pleased with this bar.  I think it would be an excellent choice for hiking or any endurance activity where carbs and protein would help provide long-term energy.  To be honest, while I still like my Snickers, I think this would be a decent tasting alternative that is much healthier and less calories.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice Alternative To The Granola And Candy Bars", "unixReviewTime": 1271721600, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2010"}

If you're living by Michael Pollan's dictum (\"the fewer ingredients, the better\"), it plays second fiddle to Larabar as well.This 1.7 oz. snack bar contains nine ingredients.  Although dates place first in the ingredient parade, it is the taste of nuts that is most prevalent in this snack.

Oddly, organic wild blueberries are the fourth ingredient and are suffused parenthetically with the rather ubiquitous organic apple juice concentrate as well as organic sunflower oil.  Odder still, the natural blueberry is supplemented with ingredient #9, organic blueberry \"flavor.\"  I say odd because this snack does not deliver a powerful blueberry taste, which I like.  Rather, the flavor of blueberry is more of an aftertaste than a hit-your-palate-as-you-chew taste.The product is small but delivers 190 calories, 70 of them from fat (as you might expect from a snack with healthy nuts).  On the plus side, you can't argue with PURE's organic pedigree.  All there, all labeled USDA organic.  Thus, the \"health\" rating is high, though I figured most curious shoppers would take that for granted based on the description.  This rating, then, is based more on taste.  Bottom line?  Not bad.

My mother runs the supplements department of a huge health food store.  I have tasted dozens of health food bars.  Most I wouldn't even consider health food because they are filled with highly-processed extracts of whole foods, such as soy protein (which most people are allergic to).  Even organic food bars are filled with unwholesome ingredients that I would never put into my body.  So I am alway eager to try an organic food bar with an ingredient list short enough to memorize.INGREDIENTSIn a single word - EXCEPTIONAL.  In the market of food bars, this bar is at the top (alongside a few others which I will list below).  Minimal ingredients, all organic, no added sugar, no added thickening agents.  Just nuts and fruits, with a little bit of added organic oil.  Great!  5 stars all the way!TASTEWhen it comes to food, taste is often the deciding factor  (when it really should be ingredients because our taste buds will change very quickly once we stop ingesting super sugary or super salty foods).  Unfortunately most people will rank this bar as mediocre in the taste department. Most people eat far too much sugar and salt in their diet, so any natural foods will taste bland and uninteresting.  For me, however, my taste buds enjoyed the balanced flavor of almond, cashew, blueberry, and date in this bar.  I give it 4 stars for flavor.  It is good, but falls just short of delicious.So there you have it.. a healthy alternative to other food bars out there.  A good natural flavor that is not too sweet.  When you just can't take a cooked me with you to work or on the road, this food bar is a good choice.Overall, I give this bar 5 stars.  5 for ingredients, 4 for flavor, and that extra 1/2 point because making great tasting organic food bars with clean ingredients is so darn difficult.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSLike I said, I have much experience in the health food world and I love passing on good information when I have it.  So here are my other recommendations for organic food bars.  I purposefully did not include most of the well-known food bars - they are so filled with processed ingredients, indigestible filler ingredients, and sugar that I would never put them in my body.1) Raw Organic Food Bar.  Yup, that's the actual brand name.  They make great bars with ingredients very similar to this bar.  The difference is Raw Organic Food Bars are more oily and sweet.  These are my personal favorites.  They have many flavors, so try a few to find your favorites.  Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolatey Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Fiber Chocolate Delite, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Cinnamon Raisin, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12)2) Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars.  These bars only contain only 3-5 ingredients per bar and everything is raw.  These bars are good as well - more flavor than the Pure Bar, but too sweet or chocolaty sometimes.Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Spirulina and Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Coconut and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Raspberry and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12).3) Greens Plus Organic Food Bars.  This company offer a variety of bars with different ingredients.  Some bars use peanut butter others use cashews.  Some bars use whey protein, others use soy.  So be sure to read the ingredient before you indulge.  This company uses more processed whole food extracts (like the protein powders), but still the company is on the right track.

The bars are nicely chewy without being gummy, and have far more flavor and are far more palatable (in my opinion) than those fruit leather strips out there. These really are almost like a chewy fruit and nut brownie in the way they're made. I do have to say, though, that if you're not a walnut lover, beware, as walnuts are the nuts that I found in the greatest supply in my bar. As the ingredients list cites walnuts as one of the nuts used, after the fact I wasn't so surprised, but since they are called cherry cashew fruit and nut bars, I was expecting to see more cashews.As the ingredients and their prevalence go, they are listed as such on the bar (everything being organic, I'm going to skip typing that out seven times): dates, cashews, cherries, rice protein concentrate (whatever that is), walnuts, agave nectar, and almonds, all raw and unprocessed.Speaking of fruit leather, these bars are about that sort of color - reddish brown, with a look of pureed fruit that's had nuts mixed into it. I do like that these are certified organic, gluten-free, raw, vegan, and contain a full serving of fruit, plenty of omega 3 fatty acids, organic protein and 3 grams of fiber per bar. I have to say, though, that I'm not keen on the fact that each little bar has 8 grams of fat, but considering that they're nut fats, they're much healthier than the other fats that might make their way into your diet.Overall, I really enjoyed the bar that I tried.

I didn't even know products like these were available.I got one bar free as a sample, and NEVER expected to purchase more.  I am back on Amazon today to buy a whole box of these!By the way, if you don't like TART flavors, you won't like this. The dried cherries (coupled with a lack of refined added sugar) make for a very naturally tart bar.

People have commented on the bars being too small, but I think they are just right (at least for me).  Actually, all bars like this tend to be small, it's just that some are longer and skinnier, which makes them seem bigger.  I've noticed that the weight is about the same - it's just that Pure's bar is short and thick, and that makes it seem so smaller.UPDATE:I liked these enough to buy a box (also bought the apple cinnamon, which I also like a lot.)

They are full of sugar and preservatives and somehow make me feel both gross and hungry when I eat them.  Though I understand the philosophy of \"everything in moderation,\" I think I've found something better in the Pure bars.  Calories are similar (190), but the ingredients are completely different.

All of it is raw, organic, and straightforward, to the extent that it really tastes like something I'd make for myself.  The consistency is smooth and dense, with some nut chunks to add a bit of texture.  The blueberry flavor and consistency is pleasant and reminds me of fresh blueberries, rather than the somewhat metallic artificial blueberry flavor found in many munchies I've munched on.There are no mysteries to these bars, so I think you can make a pretty good guess at whether they fit into your life or not.

Initial impression upon eating the bar was that there was a good strong smell and taste of blueberry, without that blueberry flavor being cloying and artificial as it sometimes is with a blueberry muffin. The bars were about 190 calories each and every ingredient was labeled as \"Organic\". 8 grams (70kcal) of fat, probably from the nuts and the Sunflower oil. They tasted like something you'd want to eat.  At 26 grams of carbs per bar, with only 2 grams of fiber, and 19 grams of sugar, this bar might not fit into your diet.  But my wife thought that two of these with a bottle of water would make a great 400 calorie lunch with zero prep.  A bar was about the size of six monopoly dice. and was 1.7 us OZ or 48 grams (come on, folks, round numbers - 2 US ounces or 50 grams).The five star rating came solely from the taste and mouthfeel.They claimed that there was \"nothing cooked\" in the bar.  I found that confusing.  Concentrates, like Orange Juice Concentrate, are cooked - they are heated until the water reduces. I likve near plants that produce such concentrate, and it is cooked. These bars contain, for example, \"Organic rice protein concentrate\", \"Organic apple concentrate\" and \"organic lemon juice concentrate. I put that those ingredients have to be cooked to be concentrated, or at least processed, and the \"Organic Rice Protein Concentrate\" has to be cooked or processed, somehow, to separate the rice protein from the rice starch.  According to the product FAQ page the brown rice protein (arguably not this rice protein) protein is raw because their supplier uses a natural enzyme to separate the protein from the carbohydrate bur the label claims \"nothing processed\" and the use of an enzyme has to count as processing.Now, they do claim to be gluten free, and nothing that is listed as an ingredient in the bar should be a source of gluten.  They support the Celiac Disease foundation openly on their label - so if you are afflicted with celiac, you might want to carry these tasty little bars with you for an afternoon pick-me-up or even a meal replacement.I got my bar free from the Vine program.

It is not unprocessed and it is in fact, a highly cooked and processed sweetener.

It is essentially a super high fructose syrup, just like high fructose corn syrup, but with a much higher fructose content.  Typical high fructose corn syrup used in soft drinks is about 55% fructose while agave nectar contains a whopping 85-90% fructose.

My first reaction to the cherry cashew was \"this tastes like 'health food'\"--maybe a good thing to some, but admittedly, I've got a sweet tooth and found the earthy taste rather bland. The cherries do add a tangy kick, but I would have preferred it to balance the tanginess with more sweetness. The texture is chewy and somewhat grainy, with a bit of nutty crunch. What the cherry cashew bar lacks in taste it makes up somewhat in its hearty, satisfying quality. It's organic, vegan, gluten free, and all-natural, making it a healthy snack. It's a great energy pick-me-up, rich in protein (7g), fiber (3g), and a variety of vitamins and minerals (though not incredibly large amounts of these--it's no true substitute for fresh fruit).

Someone with a more severe walnut allergy might have great issue with a cashew bar that has walnuts in it.The cherries were tart, but there were so few in the bar that it was possible to take a bite and not get any cherries. Perhaps they should have infused the date/rice protien base with some cherry juice to get some more flavor in the bar.I suppose if you're used to eating flavorless things like rice cakes and unsalted granolla this might be a nice bar for a snack.
